# ðŸ§  Deep Learning Lab

Welcome to the DL sandbox! This folder contains deep learning experiments and model-building from scratch and with frameworks.

## ðŸ”¬ Projects

- `cnn_mnist/`: Image classification on MNIST (PyTorch)
- `cats_vs_dogs/`: Binary image classification
- `rnn_textgen/`: RNN for character-level text generation
- `gan_faces/`: GAN to generate synthetic face images

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- Neural networks
- Convolutional networks
- Recurrent networks
- Loss functions, activation, optimizers
- Overfitting control (Dropout, BatchNorm)

## ðŸ›  Tools

- PyTorch (main)
- TensorFlow (optionally for comparison)
- matplotlib, tqdm
