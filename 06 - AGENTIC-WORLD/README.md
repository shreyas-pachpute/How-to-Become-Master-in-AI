# 🧠 Agentic World

This folder explores **AI agents** — autonomous systems that act, reason, and plan. Think beyond chatbots.

## 🤖 Experiments

- `langgraph_memory_agent/`: Memory-enabled LangGraph agent
- `crewai_task_manager/`: Multi-agent collaboration via CrewAI
- `autogen_chain_of_thought/`: Reasoning & planning agent via AutoGen

## 🌐 Concepts

- Agent architecture (tools, memory, goals)
- Planning + execution loop
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Autonomous LLM decision-making

## 🔧 Tools

- LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen
- OpenAI / Ollama
- Redis for memory

## 🎯 Goal

Build the next generation of intelligent, autonomous systems.
